### **Free Threat Feeds (Unlimited)**

- ✅ **Spamhaus**: No limits, updated daily
- ✅ **Emerging Threats**: No limits, updated frequently
- ✅ **No API Keys**: Works out of the box
- ⚠️ **Static Lists**: Less real-time than API services

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **1. Import Threat Feeds (Recommended First Step)**

1. Go to **Firewall Admin** → **Rules** tab
2. Click **"Import Threat Feeds"** button
3. Wait for import to complete (may take 30-60 seconds)
4. Review imported rules in the **Rules** tab

**What gets imported:**

- Up to 100 high-priority malicious IPs per feed
- Automatic CIDR notation for efficient blocking
- Priority 25 rules (higher than common rules)
- Descriptive names and sources

**✅ NEW: Enhanced Testing**

- **All imported threat intelligence rules are now properly tested** using the new rule testing framework
- **CIDR ranges from threat feeds** are properly validated with real IP generation
- **Overlapping threat intelligence rules** are handled correctly
- **Test results show specific threat feed attribution** in blocking reasons

### **2. Manual IP Reputation Check**

```bash
# API endpoint for manual checks
GET /api/firewall/threat-intelligence/check/203.0.113.5

# Response includes:
{
  "isBlacklisted": true,
  "confidence": 85,
  "totalReports": 23,
  "categories": ["malware", "botnet"],
  "remainingQueries": 995
}
```

### **3. View API Usage Statistics**

```bash
# Check your API usage
GET /api/firewall/threat-intelligence/stats
```

## ⚠️ **Important Usage Notes**

### **Rate Limit Management**

- **Cache System**: Results cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- **Smart Querying**: Only queries APIs when cache misses
- **Batch Import**: Threat feeds imported in bulk to minimize API usage
- **Daily Reset**: Rate limits reset at midnight UTC

### **Production Recommendations**

**For Small Sites (< 1000 visitors/day):**

- ✅ Free threat feeds only
- ✅ Optional: AbuseIPDB free tier for manual checks
- ❌ Skip VirusTotal (too limited for automation)

**For Medium Sites (1000-10000 visitors/day):**

- ✅ Free threat feeds + AbuseIPDB free tier
- ✅ Consider AbuseIPDB paid plan ($20/month)
- ✅ Manual VirusTotal checks for investigation

**For Large Sites (10000+ visitors/day):**

- ✅ AbuseIPDB paid plan (required)
- ✅ VirusTotal paid plan for comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Regular threat feed updates (daily/hourly)

## 🔄 **Automatic Updates**

### **Daily Threat Feed Updates (Recommended)**

Add to your server's cron job:

```bash
# Update threat feeds daily at 2 AM
0 2 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/firewall/threat-intelligence/import \
  -H "X-Admin-Bypass: cron" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### **Monitoring API Usage**

```bash
# Check API usage daily
curl http://localhost:5050/api/firewall/threat-intelligence/stats
```

## 🧪 **✅ NEW: Comprehensive Testing & Validation**

### **Threat Intelligence Rule Testing**

The new rule testing framework includes **comprehensive threat intelligence testing**:

1. **CIDR Range Validation**

   - Tests properly generate valid IPs within threat feed CIDR ranges
   - Handles overlapping ranges correctly (e.g., Spamhaus /23 containing /24)
   - Validates all threat feed IP blocks work as expected

2. **Rule Priority Testing**

   - Ensures threat intelligence rules (priority 25) work correctly
   - Tests interaction with other rule priorities
   - Validates first-match rule behavior

3. **Source Attribution Testing**
   - Confirms blocking reasons properly attribute to threat feeds
   - Tests rule naming and description accuracy
   - Validates threat feed metadata in logs

### **Test Threat Intelligence Rules**

```bash
# Test all threat intelligence rules
POST /api/firewall/test-all-rules
# This will test all imported threat feed rules

# Test specific threat intelligence rule
POST /api/firewall/test-rule
{
  "ruleId": "threat_feed_rule_id"
}
```

**Example Test Results:**

```
✅ Threat Feed: Spamhaus DROP - 5.188.10.0/23
Result: Rule correctly blocked IP: 5.188.10.1
Block Reason: IP blocked by rule: Threat Feed: Spamhaus DROP - 5.188.10.0/23 (5.188.10.0/23)
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Rate limit exceeded" Errors**

```
Error: AbuseIPDB rate limit exceeded (1,000/day)
Solution: Wait until midnight UTC or upgrade to paid plan
```

### **"Network timeout" Errors**

```
Error: Failed to download threat feeds
Solution: Check internet connectivity and firewall settings
```

### **"Too many rules" Warnings**

```
Warning: Database overload risk
Solution: Limit threat feed imports or clean old rules
```

### **API Key Issues**

```
Error: API key not configured
Solution: Add ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY to your .env file
```

### **✅ NEW: Threat Intelligence Rule Testing Issues**

**1. CIDR Range Rules Failing**

Previously common issue now **FIXED**:

- ✅ **Threat feed CIDR ranges** now generate proper test IPs within ranges
- ✅ **Overlapping ranges** are handled correctly (Spamhaus /22 containing /24)
- ✅ **IPv6 threat feeds** are properly tested

**2. Rule Priority Conflicts**

Use the rule testing framework to identify issues:

```bash
POST /api/firewall/test-all-rules
# Shows exactly which rules match and in what order
```

**3. Missing Threat Feed Rules**

Verify import status:

```bash
GET /api/firewall/rules?source=threat_intel
# Should show imported threat intelligence rules
```
